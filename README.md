Twitter by Jakub Paluszkiewicz
============================

## Project that I created during my course in CodersLab

This is my first application which I wrote in PHP.
There are some basics of PHP, database. I wrote this without any framework.

In this project I didn't know anything of JavaScript, I didn't have really much knowledge and skills about front-end, but application has some functionalities of authentic Twitter.

## You can:
- add posts,
- put comment of posts
- see all of your posts
- search for some users
- send, receive and read messages.
